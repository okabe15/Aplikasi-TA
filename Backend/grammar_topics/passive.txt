### OVERVIEW ###
This document provides archetypes for creating questions about passive voice vs active voice. Questions should test recognition, transformation, and appropriate usage based on the comic's context.

---

### ARCHETYPE 1: Active to Passive Transformation ###
Instruction for AI: Test ability to transform active voice sentences to passive voice using examples from the comic.

Example format:
Question: "The dialogue says, 'The dragon destroyed the village.' How would we say this in passive voice?"
Options: ["The village destroyed by the dragon", "The village was destroyed by the dragon", "The dragon was destroyed by the village", "The village destroys the dragon"]
Correct: 1
Explanation: "Passive voice: Object becomes subject + be verb + past participle + by agent. Active: 'The dragon (subject) destroyed (verb) the village (object).' Passive: 'The village (new subject) was destroyed (be + past participle) by the dragon (agent).'"
GrammarRule: "Active to Passive Transformation"

### ARCHETYPE 2: Identifying Active vs Passive ###
Instruction for AI: Test ability to recognize whether a sentence from the comic is in active or passive voice.

Example format:
Question: "Look at this sentence from Panel 3: 'The treasure was hidden by ancient wizards.' Is this active or passive voice?"
Options: ["Active voice", "Passive voice", "Neither", "Both"]
Correct: 1
Explanation: "This is passive voice. Signs: (1) Subject (treasure) receives the action rather than doing it. (2) 'Was hidden' uses 'be verb + past participle.' (3) Agent (wizards) comes after 'by.'"
GrammarRule: "Recognizing Passive Voice"

### ARCHETYPE 3: When to Use Passive Voice ###
Instruction for AI: Test understanding of when passive voice is more appropriate (unknown agent, focus on action/object, formal writing).

Example format:
Question: "The narration says, 'The castle was built in 1347.' Why is passive voice appropriate here?"
ComicReference: "Panel 2: Ancient castle, no information about builders"
Options: ["Because castles can't do actions", "Because we don't know or don't care who built it", "Because it's in the past", "Because castles are objects"]
Correct: 1
Explanation: "Passive voice is appropriate when the agent (who did the action) is unknown, unimportant, or obvious. We don't know who built the castle, and it doesn't matter to the story."
GrammarRule: "Passive Voice - Unknown/Unimportant Agent"

---

### ARCHETYPE 4: Passive Voice in Different Tenses ###
Instruction for AI: Test formation of passive voice in various tenses using the comic's context.

Example format:
Question: "How would you complete this sentence in passive voice, present continuous tense? 'Right now, the spell ___ by the wizard.'"
ComicReference: "Panel 4: Wizard currently casting a spell"
Options: ["is casting", "is being cast", "was being cast", "has been cast"]
Correct: 1
Explanation: "Passive present continuous: am/is/are + being + past participle. Active: 'The wizard is casting the spell.' Passive: 'The spell is being cast by the wizard.'"
GrammarRule: "Passive Voice - Present Continuous Tense"

---

### ARCHETYPE 5: Agent Omission in Passive ###
Instruction for AI: Test when it's appropriate to omit the agent (the 'by...' phrase) in passive voice.

Example format:
Question: "Which passive sentence is better? The narration describes general knowledge about diamonds."
Options: ["Diamonds are formed deep underground by nature", "Diamonds are formed deep underground", "Diamonds are forming deep underground by people", "Diamonds were formed by miners"]
Correct: 1
Explanation: "When the agent is obvious, general, or unimportant, we can omit it. 'Diamonds are formed deep underground' is clearer than adding 'by nature' or 'by natural processes' because it's obvious."
GrammarRule: "Passive Voice - Agent Omission"

---

### ARCHETYPE 6: Fixing Passive Voice Overuse ###
Instruction for AI: Test recognition that active voice is sometimes clearer and more direct than passive.

Example format:
Question: "The dialogue says, 'The sword was wielded by the hero, and the enemy was defeated by him.' How can this be improved?"
Options: ["Keep it as is - passive is always better", "Change to active: 'The hero wielded the sword and defeated the enemy'", "Change to: 'The sword wielded the hero'", "Add more passive verbs"]
Correct: 1
Explanation: "Active voice is often clearer and more direct: 'The hero wielded the sword and defeated the enemy.' Passive voice can make writing wordy and unclear if overused."
GrammarRule: "Active Voice - Clarity and Directness"

---

### ARCHETYPE 7: Passive with Modal Verbs ###
Instruction for AI: Test passive voice formation with modal verbs (can be, must be, should be, etc.).

Example format:
Question: "Complete this sentence in passive voice with a modal verb: 'The ancient scroll ___ with great care.'"
ComicReference: "Panel 5: Delicate old scroll that requires careful handling"
Options: ["must handle", "must be handled", "must be handling", "must have handle"]
Correct: 1
Explanation: "Passive voice with modal: modal + be + past participle. Active: 'Someone must handle the scroll carefully.' Passive: 'The scroll must be handled carefully.'"
GrammarRule: "Passive Voice with Modals"
